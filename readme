How to Run : go run main.go



Api : 

# health
curl -s localhost:8080/healthz

# metrics before any submissions (should be valid JSON with zeros)
curl -s localhost:8080/metrics | jq

#submit new user
curl --location 'localhost:8080/submit' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "user_id":112345,
    "Correct": true
}'



# now metrics and winner should update
curl -s localhost:8080/metrics | jq
curl -s localhost:8080/winner  | jq



Backend Challenge – Game Engine with User Simulator 

 

Objective: 
Build a Go-based backend system that simulates multiple users answering a game question, evaluates responses in real-time, and announces a winner. 

Shape 

Requirements: 

You must build three components: 

1. Mock User Engine 

Accepts an input N (e.g., 1000 users). 

For each user, randomly: 

Assigns a correct answer flag (yes/no). 

Adds a random delay (10–1000ms) to simulate network lag. 

Sends all responses concurrently to the API server. 

2. API Server 

Exposes an endpoint /submit to receive user responses (JSON format). 

Forwards each response to the Game Engine for evaluation. 

3. Game Engine 

Determines the first user who sent a correct answer. 

Prints the winner's user ID on the server console. 

Ignores all subsequent correct responses once a winner is found. 

Shape 

Constraints & Evaluation: 

Language: Must use Go. 

The server must handle 1000 concurrent requests without race conditions or deadlocks. 

Responses should be evaluated in real-time (no batching). 

Code must demonstrate: 

Concurrency handling (goroutines, mutexes, channels, or atomic operations). 

Clean structure (separate files/modules for Mock User Engine, API, and Game Engine). 

Correctness under load (only one winner is declared). 

Shape 

Bonus Points: 

Add metrics to track how many correct/incorrect answers were received. 

Print the winner. 

Use channels instead of only mutexes for event-driven response handling.
